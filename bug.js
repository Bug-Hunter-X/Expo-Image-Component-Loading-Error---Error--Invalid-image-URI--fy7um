This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a source URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  The URI might be incorrect, the image might not exist at the specified location, or there could be network connectivity issues preventing the image from loading.  Additionally, issues with the image's dimensions or file type could sometimes manifest as this error.
