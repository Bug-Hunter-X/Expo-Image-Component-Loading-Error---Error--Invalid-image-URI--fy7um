# Expo Image Component Loading Error: 'Error: Invalid image URI'

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Expo's Image component: failing to load images due to problems with the image source URI or network connectivity. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a solution.

## Problem:
The Expo Image component fails to load an image, resulting in a blank space where the image should be, or an error message is displayed in the console, such as 'Error: Invalid image URI'.

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully checking the image URI's validity, ensuring network access, and verifying image format compatibility.  The improved code uses error handling to gracefully manage loading failures and provides fallback mechanisms for a better user experience.
